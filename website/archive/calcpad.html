                    Tierra is South's star center on the girl's basketball team. 
                    The recent lesson on gas laws reminded her of an event that recently took place. 
                    She inflated her basketball inside her house at <span class="iTemp"></span>°C to a pressure of <span class="iPressure">23.8</span> psi. 
                    Tierra threw the ball into the back of her car to head to practice. 
                    The car, having been outside all evening, had a temperature of <span class="fTemp">3.0</span>°C. 
                    After arriving at school, the ball felt flat.
                    Now Tierra wants to use Chemistry to calculate what the new pressure of the ball would have been. 
                    What value should Tierra calculate?

                    The new helium gas cylinders have just arrived at the loading dock of a local party store. 
                    In the cool January air, the <span class="constVol"></span>-L cylinders have a pressure of <span class="iPressure"></span> atm. 
                    Once brought into the store, the cylinder’s temperatures increases to <span class="fTemp"></span>°C 
                    and the pressure adjusts to <span class="fPressure"n></span> atm. 
                    What is the outdoor temperature in °C? (Assume a constant volume.)
